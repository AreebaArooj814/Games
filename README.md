Guess the Number Game – Python Mini Project

This is a simple Guess the Number game built using Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it in the fewest attempts possible.

🧠 Features:
- Random number generation
- Hints for whether the guess is too high or too low
- Keeps track of the number of attempts
- High Score system: Saves the best (lowest) number of guesses in a hiscore.txt file

🛠 Technologies:
- Python 3
- Basic File Handling
- Random module
- Command-line interface

📁 Files:
- game.py – Main game logic
- hiscore.txt – Stores the best score across sessions

🚀 How to Play:
1. Run the game.py file.
2. Enter your guess when prompted.
3. The game will guide you if your guess is too high or too low.
4. Try to guess in the fewest attempts to set a new high score!
