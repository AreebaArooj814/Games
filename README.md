Guess the Number Game – Python Mini Project

This is a simple Guess the Number game built using Python. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it in the fewest attempts possible.

🧠 Features:
- Random number generation
- Hints for whether the guess is too high or too low
- Keeps track of the number of attempts
- High Score system: Saves the best (lowest) number of guesses in a hiscore.txt file

🛠 Technologies:
- Python 3
- Basic File Handling
- Random module
- Command-line interface

📁 Files:
- game.py – Main game logic
- hiscore.txt – Stores the best score across sessions

🚀 How to Play:
1. Run the game.py file.
2. Enter your guess when prompted.
3. The game will guide you if your guess is too high or too low.
4. Try to guess in the fewest attempts to set a new high score!



Snake-Water-Gun Game (Python)

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic "Snake, Water, Gun" game — similar to Rock, Paper, Scissors.

🎮 How the Game Works:
- The computer randomly chooses one of:  
  - s for Snake  
  - w for Water  
  - g for Gun  
- The user is prompted to choose one as well.
- The rules are:
  - Snake drinks Water → Snake wins 🐍💧
  - Gun shoots Snake → Gun wins 🔫🐍
  - Water damages Gun → Water wins 💧🔫
- If both choose the same item, it’s a tie.

📄 Features:
- Random computer choice using random.randint()
- User input for their move
- A function gamewin(comp, you) that determines the winner
- Clear output messages showing choices and result

✅ Technologies Used:
- Python (standard library)
